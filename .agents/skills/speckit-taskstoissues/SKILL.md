## ASM JSON Spec Governance

For this project, every ASM-related use of this Spec Kit skill is governed by `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

- Load `src/shared/spec/hk64s8x.v0.1.json` as the source of company instructions, registers, bit fields, addresses, vectors, memory regions, and ASM syntax.
- Do not rely on conversation memory, summaries, or prior generated code as the chip specification.
- Ensure model-facing ASM generation sends the user requirement together with a fresh `SPEC_DRIVEN_ASM_CONTEXT` payload derived from the JSON spec.
- Ensure numeric register, `JMP`, and `CALL` addresses use ASMC `H` suffix form such as `38H`, `46H`, and `20H`; treat bare decimal or `0x` numeric addresses as invalid final ASM.
- Reject pseudo instructions absent from the JSON spec, including `ORG`, `END`, `EQU`, `DB`, `DS`, `DW`, `SECTION`, and `INCLUDE`; treat `R` in instruction syntax as an operand placeholder, not a real register, and use RAM H-suffix addresses such as `80H` for temporary counters instead of invented `R0`/`R1`/`R2`.
- Require software delay counters to use write-back skip instructions such as `DECSZR`/`INCSZR`, not `DECSZ`/`INCSZ`, because non-write-back skip instructions can lock LED code in one visible state.
- Require software delay loops to be estimated against the requested clock and interval; for 16MHz and 500ms LED blinking, `#0AH/#FFH/#FFH` is the expected three-level `DECSZR` scale while `#7AH/#FFH/#FFH` is far too long.
- Treat hidden main-path local rewrites through `createPlan`, `generateValidatedAsm`, templates, or one-click normalization as CRITICAL constitution violations.
- Treat missing local validation through `parseAsm + validateAsm` or `npm run asm:validate -- <file.asm>` as a CRITICAL gate failure.
- When generating checklists for ASM work, include ASM quality checklist items for spec citation, prompt payload attachment, direct model ASM output, no hidden local rewrite, invalid-output rejection, and local validation.

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before tasks-to-issues conversion)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_taskstoissues` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing slash commands from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` -> `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
1. **IF EXISTS**: Load `/memory/constitution.md` for project principles and governance constraints.
1. From the executed script, extract the path to **tasks**.
1. Get the Git remote by running:

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

> [!CAUTION]
> ONLY PROCEED TO NEXT STEPS IF THE REMOTE IS A GITHUB URL

1. **Fetch existing issues for deduplication**: Before creating anything, build the set of task IDs you are about to process from `tasks.md` (each is a `T` followed by three digits, e.g. `T001`). Then use the GitHub MCP server's `list_issues` tool to look for issues that already cover those IDs. Do not pass a `state` value, since omitting it makes the tool return both open and closed issues. Request `perPage: 100` to keep the number of calls down, and since the tool uses cursor-based pagination, request pages with the `after` parameter (using the `endCursor` from the previous response). For each issue title, match it against the task ID pattern `\bT\d{3}\b` (word boundaries so tokens like `ST001` or `T0010` are not matched by mistake; this also recognises titles written as `T001 ...`, `T001: ...` or `[T001] ...`) and, when it matches one of your task IDs, mark that ID as already having an issue. Stop paginating as soon as every task ID has been matched, or when there are no more pages, so you do not keep fetching the whole repository's issue history once all task IDs are accounted for. This bounds the number of calls on repos with large issue histories and still prevents duplicates when the command is re-run after `tasks.md` is regenerated or the skill is re-invoked.
1. For each task in the list, use the GitHub MCP server to create a new issue in the repository that is representative of the Git remote. Task lines in `tasks.md` start with a markdown checkbox, so first strip the leading `- [ ]` (and any `[P]` / `[US#]` markers) to recover the task ID and its description. Create the issue with a single canonical title of the form `T001: <description>`, with the ID written once followed by the task description (for example, the line `- [ ] T001 Create project structure` becomes the title `T001: Create project structure`).
   - **Skip** any task whose ID is already present in the set of existing issues from the previous step, and report it (for example, `T001 already has an issue, skipping`).
   - Only create issues for tasks that do not yet have a matching issue.

> [!CAUTION]
> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER CREATE ISSUES IN REPOSITORIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THE REMOTE URL

## Post-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (after tasks-to-issues conversion)**:
Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_taskstoissues` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing slash commands from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` -> `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently
